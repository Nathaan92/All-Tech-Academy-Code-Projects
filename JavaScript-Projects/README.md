were a mix of self made and guided.

<dt>JavaScript Projects</dt>
<dd>This directory contains various projects. Thes include: Calculator (a basic calculator), Pizza Project (a pizza ordering webpage),
Projects (a collection of code), and Tic Tac Toe ( a PvE game). These projects were guided but to trial myself I would try to contruct the 
code prior to the instructor. This was an excelent oportunity to learn how to think more like a developer and to plot out
the logic of a program.

<dt>Basic JavaScript Projects</dt>
<dd>These are examples of JS code that I wrote. While they are not impressive they are an example of what I have been trained in.
