	<dt>Final Drill Prompt:</dt>
	<dd>Final Drill:
	We are going to pretend that you work for a small software firm. The firm has written a piece of software using Small Basic and it currently has an error. Your company has requested that you make the appropriate correction.

	You will need to fork the project files from the remote repository to your own GitHub account, clone the forked files onto your local hard drive, make your changes, commit your changes back up to your GitHub account, and create a pull request, which will effectively notify your employer that your changes are ready for review.

	1.) Sign in or create your own personal GitHub profile.
	2.) From inside of your account profile, use the search field for and open the, “the-tech-academy/office_hours”, The Tech Academy’s GitHub repository.
	3.) With the-tech-academy/office_hours repository open, click the “Fork” button and create a fork that will be attached to your own GitHub account.
	4. Now that you have the fork of the project attached to your own profile, click on the “Clone or download” button.
	5.) Click the “Open in Desktop” link to launch the GitHub’s Desktop application.
	6.) From GitHub’s Desktop application, enter the local directory where you would like to paste the cloned repository into.
	7.) Navigate into the local directory of the repository you just created to begin editing the "officeHours.sb" file.
	8.) Using the Microsoft’s Small Basic Editor or a text editor, open “officeHours.sb” and on line 24, there is a typo. It currently reflects “Office Hour” but Your company has requested that you change “Office Hour” to “Office Hours” so that it is plural.
	9.) That’s it! Just be sure to commit your changes to your local repository so as to not lose any vital work.
	10.) Now that you have committed your changes into your own local cloned repository, you next will need to push your changes back up to your forked remote repository on your GitHub profile.
	11.) When all of your edits have been completed and pushed back up to your forked-remote repository, you will need to send your contributions to the original master branch of the “the-tech-academy/office_hours” repository. Select the “New Pull Request” button.
	12.) Once you've created a pull request, you will effectively be making your changes available for the project leader to see and verify and ultimately accept or deny your proposed changes into the master branch. (Since this project is hypothetical, no one will actually be merging your changes)
	13.) To complete the drill, copy your applicable GitHub link for the project into the box below and click submit.
