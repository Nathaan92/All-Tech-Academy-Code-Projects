	1. Define and learn how to utilize the HTML alt attribute.
	2. Open your Basic_HTML_1.html file and add an image (<img> element).
	3. Utilize the alt attribute to specify an alternative text to be used when the image can’t be displayed.
	4. Save your code and successfully run it in the browser.
	5. Return to the Basic_HTML_1.html file and intentionally mess up the src attribute (for example: delete the “r” from src). Save your code.
	6. Run your code in the browser. Due to the syntax error in your src attribute, the alternative text displays in the browser.
		NOTE: This will also occur if there is ever an error with your image (such as poor internet connection or a mistake in the image URL).
