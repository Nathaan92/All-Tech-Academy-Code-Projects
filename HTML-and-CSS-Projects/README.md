  <dt>HTML and CSS Projects</dt>

  <dt>Project Description:</dt>
  <dd>This is a collection of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and a minor number of JS webpages that I have worked during my schooling.
Whereas there are many examples of small webpages demonstrating some HTML, CSS, and JS elements I have also included a few of my projects.

<dt>Space Tourism Project</dt>
<dd>This was one of my first attempts at a HTML webpage with CSS stying. 
The webpage demonstrated utilization of multiple CSS elements. This project was partially guidied but included 
a number of do it yourself portions.

<dt>Bootstrap Project</dt>
<dd>This is a cinima webpage that demonstrates use of the Bootstrap styling. This project was partially guidied but included 
a number of do it yourself portions.

<dt>One Page Webpage</dt>
<dd>This was one of my final projects where I used HTML, CSS, and JS to create a car tire step by step replacment guide.
This includes embedding youtube videos and images to create a thorough guide. This was entirly self made and while it is 
not stylistically impressive it is none the less of my building blocks of my coding
