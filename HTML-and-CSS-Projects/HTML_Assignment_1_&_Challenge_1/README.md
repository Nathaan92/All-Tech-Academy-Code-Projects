	1. Open Notepad++ and create a new HTML webpage that includes a link to a Youtube video about dogs.
	2. Save this file as Dog_Video.html within your local repository.
	3. Using <nav> tags, create the following navigation links (implicit href links) within the Dog_Video.html file:
		Home (link to Assignment.html)
		Dog Picture (link to Dog.html)
		Dog Video (link to Dog_Video.html)
	4. Copy the nav element (Home, Dog Picture, etc.) so you can paste it into other files, and then save the Dog_Video.html file again.
	5. Open the Assignment.html file in Notepad++. Paste the nav element (Home, Dog Picture, etc.) within the Assignment.html file, and then save the file.
	6. Open the Dog.html file in Notepad++. Paste the nav element (Home, Dog Picture, etc.) within the Assignment.html file, and then save the file.
		NOTE: All of your .html files should now have navigation links, linking them all together.
	7. Run Assignment.html in the browser. Click on the nav bar to ensure the links work properly on each webpage.
		TIPS:
		1. Each file must contain the required HTML code (i.e. <html> element, DOCTYPE declaration, etc.)
		2. Ensure each file is saved with the .html extension
		3. Ensure each file is saved within your local repository
		4. Use implicit links for nav elements
