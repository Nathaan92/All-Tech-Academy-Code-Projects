C# Projects

These are small Projects that I have made using C# and .Net Framework

Projects:

- Car Insurance
- Newsletter

Car Insurance 
This project is a MVC web application that mimics certain functionality of a car website.
It takes the users personal and vehicle information and calculates a quote based on business logic. 
It includes an admin page that allows staff to view all quotes that have been issued.

-Newsletter
This project is a MVC web application that allows users to sign up for a newsletter. 
Users input their personal information that gets added to a database. 
The admin has access to view the Db and the ability to unsubscribe the user.
